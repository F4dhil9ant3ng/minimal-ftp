# Quick start
The only development dependency of this project is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). So just make sure you have it installed.
Then type few commands known to every Node developer...
```
git clone https://github.com/arifcakiroglu/minimal-ftp.git
cd minimal-ftp
npm install
npm start
```


# Development

#### Installation

```
npm install
```

#### Starting the app

```
npm start
```

# Making a release

To make ready for distribution installer use command:
```
npm run release
```
It will start the packaging process for operating system you are running this command on. Ready for distribution file will be outputted to `releases` directory.

You can create Windows installer only when running on Windows, the same is true for Linux and OSX. So to generate all three installers you need all three operating systems.
